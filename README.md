# 3D-Geometric-Texture-Segmentation

This code is a c++ plugin of MEPP platform. It offers a geometric texture segmentation on 3D triangular meshes. The proposed method is a scale-aware approach that takes as input a 3D mesh and a user-scale. 

Based on CGAL, Qt, libQGLViewer, OpenGL, Boost, FFmpeg and CMake, MEPP aims at building a framework around novel mesh processing techniques. Oriented towards modularity, it targets developers as well as GUI users.

It federates the developments on mesh processing of the LIRIS research team M2DISCO.

MEPP works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
It supports dynamic meshes.

MEPP ​​is a platform development environment based on the class "Polyhedron" of CGAL, for processing and visualization of mesh and mesh sequences.
It allows the loading of multiple meshes or mesh sequences, processing and visualization.
It is intended for engineers, researchers but also to students with a quick start, facilitated by the proposed architecture.


Supported formats :
- obj (Wavefront),
- off (Object File Format),
- ply (Polygon File Format),
- smf (3D World Studio),
- x3d (XML based royalty-free open standard file format).


Exports :
- image capture,
- video capture.
